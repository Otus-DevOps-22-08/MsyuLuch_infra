# Foreground process (do not use --daemon in ExecStart or config.rb)
Type=simple

# Preferably configure a non-privileged user

# The path to the your application code root directory
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/reddit

# The command to start Puma
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/puma

# Should systemd restart puma?
# Use "no" (the default) to ensure no interference when using
# stop/start/restart via `pumactl`.  The "on-failure" setting might
# work better for this purpose, but you must test it.
# Use "always" if only `systemctl` is used for start/stop/restart, and
# reconsider if you actually need the forking config.
